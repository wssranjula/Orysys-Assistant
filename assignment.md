AI Lead Technical Assessment 
Objective 
Design and implement an enterprise-grade AI Assistant capable of answering questions from 
organizational knowledge sources while demonstrating modern agentic AI patterns, 
observability, security controls, and production-ready engineering practices. 
The solution should showcase your ability to design scalable AI systems rather than simply 
connecting an LLM to a vector database. 
Can use any AI tools , but heavily checking the explainability  and surrounding logic with code 
readability . 
Try to cover as much as possible picking up what is matter for POC first with given time . 
Maintain git commit history on the repo.  
You may have many questions in the middle , you can make assumptions on any question by 
picking the best path as you see .   
Business Scenario 
A company maintains thousands of internal documents including: 
● Policies 
● Architecture documents 
● Runbooks 
● Incident reports 
● Product specifications 
● Meeting notes 
Employees need a conversational assistant that can: 
● Search across documents 
● Answer questions 
● Explain reasoning 
● Retrieve supporting evidence 
● Maintain conversation context 
● Invoke external tools when required 
The platform must support multiple user roles with controlled access to information and tools. 
Technical Requirements 
Frontend 
Implement a lightweight chat interface using: 
● Streamlit 
UI beauty is not important. 
Focus on functionality and transparency. 
Required UI Features 
Chat Window 
● Multi-turn conversations 
● Streaming responses 
Agent Activity Panel 
Display in real time: 
● Current agent state 
● Active node in LangGraph(Deep agents) 
● Tool calls being executed 
● Retrieval status 
● Memory updates 
● Validation results 
● Final response generation 
The evaluator should be able to observe what the agent is doing internally. 
Backend 
Implement using: 
● Python   
● FastAPI 
● Async programming patterns 
Requirements: 
● Async APIs 
● Async retrieval 
● Async tool execution 
● Proper exception handling 
● Structured logging 
AI Architecture 
LangGraph 
Use LangGraph as the orchestration engine. 
The graph should include multiple specialized agents. 
Example only: 
Supervisor Agent 
Responsible for: 
● Intent understanding 
● Task decomposition 
● Agent routing 
Retrieval Agent 
Responsible for: 
● RAG operations 
● Vector search 
Research Agent 
Responsible for: 
● Deep investigation 
● Recursive exploration 
Response Agent 
Responsible for: 
● Final answer generation 
Recursive Language Model (RLM) 
The solution must demonstrate Recursive Language Model concepts. 
Rather than loading entire documents into the LLM context: 
The agent should: 
1. Explore document collections 
2. Generate Python-based search plans 
3. Decompose large tasks 
4. Retrieve targeted sections 
5. Call sub-agents recursively 
6. Aggregate results 
Example: 
User asks: 
Summarize all outage reports related to payment failures during the last year and 
identify recurring root causes. 
Expected behaviour: 
● Search relevant documents 
● Filter by topic 
● Break into batches 
● Analyze batches separately 
● Aggregate findings 
● Produce final summary 
The candidate may implement a simplified version but should demonstrate the concept. 
Retrieval Architecture 
Implement hybrid search. 
Dense Search 
Using embeddings. 
Sparse Search 
Keyword/BM25 search. 
Hybrid Ranking 
Combine: 
● Dense score 
● Sparse score 
Vector Database 
Use Pinecone. 
Requirements: 
● Namespaces 
● Metadata filtering 
● Hybrid retrieval 
● Document attribution 
Metadata examples: 
{ 
"department": "payments", 
"document_type": "incident", 
"access_level": "internal", 
"created_date": "2025-01-01" 
} 
Memory 
Implement conversational memory. 
Should maintain: 
● User context 
● Previous questions 
● Relevant historical interactions 
Memory should survive multiple turns during a session. 
Explain memory design decisions. 
Tool Calling 
At minimum implement tools for: 
Knowledge Search Tool 
Search indexed documents. 
MCP Tool 
Create a simple MCP server exposing dummy enterprise data.(not a high priority requirment) 
Example: 
● Employee directory 
● Service catalog 
● Incident records 
The agent should invoke MCP tools when required. 
Python Analysis Tool 
Perform structured analysis on retrieved data. 
LLM 
Any modern LLM may be used. 
Examples: 
● OpenAI 
● Anthropic 
● Gemini 
● Open-source alternatives 
Model selection rationale should be documented. 
Observability 
LangSmith 
Mandatory. 
Requirements: 
● Trace every conversation 
● Trace tool calls 
● Trace agent transitions 
● Trace retrieval operations 
The evaluator should be able to inspect execution traces. 
Security Requirements 
Prompt Injection Protection 
Implement protections against: 
● Instruction override attempts 
● Data exfiltration attempts 
● Tool abuse attempts 
Document the approach. 
Input Validation 
Validate: 
● User requests 
● Tool parameters 
● Retrieved content 
Guardrails 
Implement guardrails for: 
● Unsafe tool execution 
● Unauthorized access 
● Hallucinated citations 
● Invalid responses 
● Consider about the brand value (you can use commercial bank as the bot own company) 
Authentication and Authorization 
Implement one of: 
Option A 
Hardcoded users and roles 
or 
Option B 
Open-source authentication solution 
Examples only: 
● Keycloak 
Role Based Access Control 
Required roles: 
Viewer 
Allowed: 
● Chat 
● Search 
Not allowed: 
● Administrative tools 
Analyst 
Allowed: 
● Search 
● Analytics tools 
● MCP tools 
Administrator 
Allowed: 
● All tools 
Tool execution must respect role permissions. 
The agent should not be able to bypass authorization. 
Rate Limiting 
Implement Token Bucket rate limiting. 
Requirements: 
● Per-user limits 
● Configurable thresholds 
● Graceful error handling 
Error Handling 
Demonstrate handling for: 
● LLM failures 
● Vector DB failures 
● MCP failures 
● Tool timeouts 
● Invalid requests 
The application should degrade gracefully. 
Sample Documents 
Candidate may create mock data including:(you can generate this) 
● Incident reports 
● Architecture documents 
● Operational runbooks 
● Product specifications
